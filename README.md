## Project
Reinforcement learning using a simple reward sistem has been proven to be able to evolve swarming behaviours in a predator-prey sistem (https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1367-2630/acf33a). 
Our idea is to take the RL approach and apply it to a different problem, specifically emergence of social distancing in populations. The system will be constructed so that information exchange is 
rewarded while pathogen exchange is penalized. Our goal is to see if simple rules can lead to the evolution of of known social distancing habits. (example in ants: https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aat4793).
